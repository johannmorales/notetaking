# Note Taking App

Demo app used to create apps. Backend written in python and frontend written in typescript.

Most functionality is straight forward, notes are saved on-the-go by a debounced api call

Next steps would be to include deploying configuration. Terraform, Docker Containers, Deploy Manual.

# Login

You can login with

- user: admin@admin.com
- password: admin

# AI

Used ChatGPT and DeepSeek to generate code for backend and frontend project structure. It was mostly a back and forth trying to find a better approach to what the AI was suggesting.

Some comments left intentional to show which files were given by the AI.

AI usage really reduced the development time, really like working with this tools.

# Tasks

The development order was

- Frontend template
- Backend with the help of AI
- Connecting front end and backend
- Readme & demo
